This is the code for the "Huggable Animals" text adventure.
This program was written as a final project for the
Codecademy CS101 curriculum.

The game will present the player with a randomly selected animal.
The play must then select available actions to attempt to
befriend the animal until it eventually allows them to hug
it. The game is won if the player is able to successfully hug
the dragon.
